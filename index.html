            <h1>The Interplay Between Inflation and Unemployment</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my exploration of the relationship between CPI Inflation (Black Line) and Unemployment Rates (Colored Lines). <br> <br>

                This dynamic is often illustrated by the Phillips Curve, which suggests that lower unemployment can lead to higher inflation, and vice versa. Various economic factors like demand, production costs, and future inflation expectations also influence this relationship. My interactive visualizations aim to shed light on how central banks and governments use monetary and fiscal policies to balance these factors, striving for a stable economy. Dive in to visualize historical contexts, such as the 1970s stagflation, 1980s interest rate raises, and the 2008 financial crisis, that shape our current economic policy and economic landscape.
